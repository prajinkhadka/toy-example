## Context on the Product
We need to know where the product fits in in their overall scheme of things.

### Why do you need this new system?   What is the business need?    
This new generation of people use social media to express any emotion they feel. Be it anger, disgust, fear, love, happiness or sadness. With social media offering different API to fetch the data we can use these to analyze how people are feeling about our products. Once we know that we can even create new products or improve our existing products. Therefore understanding the emotion of people will help us devise good business plans and products that can target the underrepresented people and discomfort people are facing because of our product.

### Is there a system in place to do it right now (even if manual)?   If so, how is it done right now?   Is the process documented?    
Well we basically have all the system ready because we are a software behemoth and we have smart people working for us around the clock globally. This isn’t any new issue. However, we want to improve this product because our world system doesn’t seem to be working well enough to generate revenue. We want to try some new perspectives and workon on it.  
Our current approach involves getting the data, classifying them manually. As a result we aren’t able to get required information at a faster rate. We tried using AI models but that didn’t work for us.  

### Even if not, How would an expert in space approach this problem?   What would be the variables/pieces of data that person would base a solution on?   
_These questions help us picture and formulate a simple baseline and also gain insights into some domain intuitions that might be helpful in the future._

Our past experience from working with different natural language researchers shows that they start using different n-grams models and perform some naive bayes classification to get the score. As a result it gives some okayish results but that is far from enough for us. We want excellence. Because we are Soft.

### What features do you like about your current system?  
This AI is garbage therefore we just have to manually tag the system. As a result we are having a hard time dealing with large amounts of data. Our servers scrape tons of data from twitter but we aren’t able to process these. Current Machine learning solution seems to be limiting.

### What features don't you like about the current system?  
_Helps identify pain points._  

The fact it is garbage. It is so slow we don’t even want to talk about it. If it were fast, it could have solved the speed issue because we can manually validate. But the algorithm is painfully slow and inefficient. 

## About the new system/product

### What are the basic, crucial needs of the new software?  
As we mentioned earlier, we want to know how people are feeling about the product. We want to know which features are making them angry and which ones are slowing their life.

### What benefit can the product provide for your customers?  
Once we get to know about our customers and their emotions we can create better products or even improve our preexisting product line. We don’t want Hard to get ahead of us!
### What should be the top priority?   
_We should be able to distinguish the must-haves, should-haves and could-haves._

It shuld be able to know how our customers are feeling. 
It should accurately predict the emotions and group the tweets according to product and emotions.



### What are the acceptance criteria, if any?  

_Please be specific. Eg: 20% decrease in manual responses to tickets. Do you have systems in place to measure those metrics?   
If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it._  

We will get your product if you can correctly classify the tweets and sentences with precision of 70%. Your product should also group these tweets according to products.


## System Usage

### Which of your staff will be using or involved in the product the most?   
Our AI team has been involved in this project.

### Will the system need to integrate with any other type of software?  
These will influence how the system is built later on.
No this is a standalone product. Just gives us an api to feed in the input data. That would be more than enough for us.


## About the Data


### What data do you have that might be related, in any way, to the problem being solved?  
Practically, we can never have too much data. 
We have sentences that is classified into different types of information. So don’t worry about deficiency of data. We have plenty of them.

### How is the data stored, manipulated right now?   What’s your data infrastructure?  

_How they store and process the data that they have may influence our own processes and possibilities._

It is stored on our servers.

### Do you have internal data-dedicated teams?  
_It’s helpful to know, to some extent, their data expertise._

Well use have one team but they are now occupied with something else therefore won’t be available at all.

## Caveats

### What are the constraints on the system being built (resourcing, timing, etc)?   
We want a rough baseline from you in 10 days.

### What is the strategy for your organisation?   [One year, five years]. Are there considerations that need to be taken into account?  
This will be the first prototype for our project and we want to see how well this is going to perform.

## General
### Do you have a timeline in mind?   
We can give you a week or two. Let’s see what you can come with till then. Based on that result we will devise a full blown plan.





# Requirements Analysis

### General Study

Our client is a large technological company that has been working to empower different businesses and individuals throughout the world. Their mission seems to be creating infrastructure, tools and innovative products to empower their users. As a result of this, they want to know how well their products are performing. 

The company has collected data from different social media streams. They have classified these social media feeds based on the emotion on the feed. As a result they want to design a survey that can help them perform visualization about performance of their product.

### Requirements

The company wants to create a product that can classify the emotions present in the social media feeds which in return can help them access the performance of their products.

### The major requirements are:

1. The company wants to automate the process of classifying the feeds. 
2. The tool is an internal tool that the company wants to use for itself.
3. The tool should be able to classify the feeds at large scale so that it can speed up the evaluation process.

### Functional Requirements

1. Based on our interview, they want the solution to be a web-based solution.
2. They want to use the state-of-the-art technology that will help them automate the process.
3. The classifier should have at least 70% accuracy.
4. Their prediction metric is based on performance with actual classification made by humans. Therefore we can use the cross entropy function.
5. Finally for a given product it should be able to visualize all the emotions.

### Timeline

The company seems to be in need of a prototype. Therefore it is advisable to finish the product within a week or two.
